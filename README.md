# Starry Night
A dark Vim/Neovim color scheme with rich colors on a deep black background.

Starry Night was inspired by the emotions I get from Van Gogh's usage of bright colors on what should otherwise be a darker palette, and by some beautiful colors from the [base16-eighties.vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim "base16-eighties.vim") color scheme. The color scheme itself was created with the [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate "Colortemplate") plugin.

This color scheme is mostly intended to be used on a GUI. Terminal colors are supported but they were not thoroughly tested and they are simply my best attempt to set the closest matching color available. Constructive feedback is welcome.
